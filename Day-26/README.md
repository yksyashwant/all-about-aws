### What is SSM
AWS Systems Manager (SSM) is a management service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that helps you automate tasks across your AWS resources and on-premises environments. It provides a unified user interface that allows you to view operational data from multiple AWS services and automate operational tasks across AWS resources.

### Key Features of AWS Systems Manager:

1. **Automation**:
   - AWS Systems Manager Automation allows you to automate common maintenance and deployment tasks such as patching, updating agents, and executing workflows across multiple instances.

2. **Run Command**:
   - Run Command enables you to remotely execute commands on your Amazon EC2 instances and on-premises servers. This can include tasks such as running PowerShell scripts or shell commands.

3. **Parameter Store**:
   - Parameter Store provides secure storage for configuration and secrets management, such as database credentials, API keys, and configuration strings. Parameters can be encrypted with AWS KMS (Key Management Service) for added security.

4. **Session Manager**:
   - Session Manager allows you to securely connect to your instances without the need for SSH/RDP access. It provides interactive shell access to instances through the AWS Management Console, CLI, or SDK.

5. **Patch Manager**:
   - Patch Manager automates the process of patching Amazon EC2 instances and on-premises servers with security patches provided by AWS or custom patches defined by you.

6. **State Manager**:
   - State Manager allows you to define and enforce system configurations for your instances. It ensures instances are in a consistent state, applying configuration changes and maintaining compliance.

7. **OpsCenter**:
   - OpsCenter provides a central location to view, investigate, and resolve operational issues related to AWS resources, including EC2 instances, Systems Manager documents, and OpsItems (operational tasks and issues).

8. **Maintenance Windows**:
   - Maintenance Windows allow you to define a schedule for performing administrative tasks, such as patching and updates, across your instances and resources.

### What is SSM Agent?

- **SSM Agent** is a software agent installed and configured on Amazon EC2 instances, on-premises servers, or virtual machines that are managed by AWS Systems Manager.
- The SSM Agent processes requests from Systems Manager services and securely communicates with the Systems Manager API.

### Working with SSM Agent

SSM Agent enables the following capabilities:
- **Managed Instances:** Enables Systems Manager to manage your instances, including installing or removing software, running scripts, and configuring applications.
- **Run Command:** Allows you to remotely execute scripts or commands on your instances without needing to SSH into them.
- **State Manager:** Ensures your instances are configured per your desired state, enforcing configurations and applying updates automatically.
- **Inventory and Patch Management:** Collects metadata about your instances, installed applications, and patches, facilitating inventory management and patch deployments.
----
### Install SSM Agent on EC2 Instance:
To install SSM Agent on an EC2 instance, you typically follow these steps:

### Prerequisites:
- Your EC2 instance must have an IAM role attached that grants it permissions to communicate with AWS Systems Manager (SSM). Ensure the IAM role has the necessary policies attached (e.g., AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore).

### Installation Steps:

1. **Connect to Your EC2 Instance**:
   You can connect to your EC2 instance using SSH (for Linux) or RDP (for Windows). Ensure you have administrative privileges on the instance.

2. **Download and Install SSM Agent**:
   
   - For **Amazon Linux 2** or **Ubuntu Server**:

     ```bash
     sudo yum install -y amazon-ssm-agent  # Amazon Linux 2
     sudo apt-get install -y amazon-ssm-agent  # Ubuntu Server
     ```

   - For **Amazon Linux** or **RHEL**:

     ```bash
     sudo yum install -y https://s3.amazonaws.com/ec2-downloads-windows/SSMAgent/latest/linux_amd64/amazon-ssm-agent.rpm
     ```

   - For **Windows Server**:
     - Download the SSM Agent installer package from the AWS SSM documentation or use the Systems Manager console.
     - Run the installer package and follow the installation prompts.

3. **Start and Enable SSM Agent**:
   
   - For **Amazon Linux 2** or **Ubuntu Server**:

     ```bash
     sudo systemctl start amazon-ssm-agent
     sudo systemctl enable amazon-ssm-agent
     ```

   - For **Amazon Linux** or **RHEL**:

     ```bash
     sudo start amazon-ssm-agent
     sudo chkconfig amazon-ssm-agent on
     ```

   - For **Windows Server**:
     - The installer typically starts the service automatically. Ensure it's running from the Services management console (`services.msc`).

4. **Verify SSM Agent Installation**:
   - Check the status of SSM Agent to ensure it's running without errors:

     ```bash
     sudo systemctl status amazon-ssm-agent  # Linux
     Get-Service AmazonSSMAgent -ComputerName "."  # Windows
     ```

5. **Verify Connectivity**:
   - Go to the AWS Systems Manager console and navigate to "Managed Instances". Verify that your EC2 instance appears and shows as "Online".

Once installed and configured, your EC2 instance is ready to use with AWS Systems Manager, allowing you to manage it using various Systems Manager capabilities such as Run Command, Patch Manager, and Session Manager.
