### What is AWS ECR?

**Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR):** A fully managed Docker container registry service provided by AWS. It allows developers to store, manage, and deploy Docker container images.

### Features of Amazon ECR

1. **Fully Managed:** AWS manages infrastructure provisioning, scaling, and availability.
2. **Integrated with AWS Services:** Works seamlessly with services like Amazon ECS, Kubernetes, and AWS CodePipeline.
3. **Security:** Integrates with IAM for access control and supports encryption of images at rest.

----
### Types of Repositories in AWS ECR

1. **Private Repositories:** Used to store and manage Docker container images privately.
2. **Public Repositories:** Used to share Docker container images publicly.
----
### Components of Amazon ECR

1. **Registry**: 
   - Each AWS account has an Amazon ECR private registry.
   - You can create multiple repositories within your registry to store images.

2. **Authorization Token**: 
   - Your client must authenticate to Amazon ECR registries as an AWS user to push and pull images.

3. **Repository**: 
   - Stores Docker images, Open Container Initiative (OCI) images, and OCI compatible artifacts.

4. **Repository Policy**: 
   - Controls access to repositories and images with policies.

5. **Image**: 
   - You can push and pull container images to your repositories.
   - These images can be used locally on your development system or in Amazon ECS task definitions and Amazon EKS pod specifications.

### Lab Session - Pushing a Docker Image to AWS ECR

1. **Install Docker:** Ensure Docker is installed on your local machine.

2. **Authenticate Docker with ECR:**
   - Run `aws ecr get-login-password --region <region>` to retrieve authentication token.
   - Run `docker login -u AWS -p <password> <aws_account_id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com` to authenticate Docker with ECR.

3. **Tag Docker Image:**
   - Tag your Docker image using `docker tag <local_image>:<tag> <aws_account_id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/<repository_name>:<tag>`.

4. **Push Docker Image:**
   - Push your Docker image to ECR using `docker push <aws_account_id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/<repository_name>:<tag>`.
