## 📦 Cloud Migration Strategies: The 6 R's

When migrating workloads to the cloud, organizations typically follow one or more of the following six strategies, commonly known as the **6 R’s of Cloud Migration**:

---

### 1. 🚚 Lift and Shift (Rehost)

- **Definition**: Move applications to the cloud **without modifying** them.
- **When to Use**: 
  - Quick migrations
  - Legacy systems
  - When minimal change is required
- **Example**: Migrating a virtual machine from on-premises to AWS EC2 without altering the application.

---

### 2. 🔧 Replatform (Lift, Tinker, and Shift)

- **Definition**: Move to the cloud with **minor optimizations** to take advantage of cloud-native capabilities.
- **When to Use**:
  - To improve performance or cost
  - When small changes are feasible
- **Example**: Migrating an app to AWS EC2 and replacing a local database with Amazon RDS.

---

### 3. 🧬 Refactor / Rearchitect

- **Definition**: **Redesign** the application to be **cloud-native**, often involving significant changes.
- **When to Use**:
  - For scalability, agility, or long-term cost savings
  - To adopt microservices, containers, or serverless architectures
- **Example**: Refactoring a monolithic application into a microservices-based architecture using AWS Lambda for compute, API Gateway for routing, and DynamoDB as a scalable NoSQL database.

---

### 4. 🗑️ Retire

- **Definition**: **Decommission** applications that are no longer useful.
- **When to Use**:
  - During assessment, when apps are identified as obsolete or redundant
- **Example**: Shutting down an old internal reporting tool that is no longer used.

---

### 5. 🛑 Retain

- **Definition**: **Keep** certain applications on-premises or **delay** migration.
- **When to Use**:
  - Compliance or regulatory concerns
  - Low priority applications
  - Systems not yet ready for migration
- **Example**: Retaining an ERP system that requires on-prem hosting due to licensing constraints.

---

### 6. 🛒 Repurchase

- **Definition**: Move to a **SaaS-based solution**, effectively replacing the existing system.
- **When to Use**:
  - When a better SaaS alternative exists
  - For faster time to value and reduced management overhead
- **Example**: Moving from a self-hosted CRM to Salesforce or Microsoft 365.

## **Phase 2: Infrastructure Setup**  

### **Step 10: Architecture Design**  
- Respective **Architects** will design the implementation architecture for this migration.  

### **Step 11: Task Execution Begins**  
- Based on assigned tasks in JIRA, **DevOps engineers** and the **Development team** start executing tasks based on priority.  

### **Step 12: AWS Account Creation**  
- If AWS accounts are not already available, create AWS accounts as per the migration plan.  
- Either set up **environment-specific accounts** (e.g., separate accounts for **Dev, Test, QA**) or consolidate **all lower environments** into a single AWS account.  
- **Production, Pre-Prod, and Infrastructure** accounts should be separate for security and compliance.  

### **Step 13: AWS Networking Setup via Terraform**  
- The **DevOps engineer** sets up AWS networking components, including:  
  - **VPC, Subnets, Route Tables, NAT Gateways, Internet Gateways, Security Groups, NACLs**  
  - Setting up the **Transit Gateway (TGW)** if required for multi-environment networking  

#### **Example: VPC CIDR Blocks**  
- **DEV CIDR** - 10.20.0.0/16  
- **TEST CIDR** - 10.30.0.0/16  
- **UAT CIDR** - 10.40.0.0/16  
- **PRE-PROD CIDR** - 10.50.0.0/16  
- **PROD CIDR** - 10.60.0.0/16  
- **INFRA CIDR** - 10.70.0.0/16  
**Note:** Wherever applicable, we will use **Terraform** to automate infrastructure provisioning.  
### **Step 14: Site-to-Site VPN Setup**  
- Work with the **on-premises network team** to establish a **Site-to-Site VPN** between **on-premises** and **AWS**.  
- Test **connectivity** to ensure smooth integration with AWS resources.  
**Note:** Wherever applicable, we will use **Terraform** to automate infrastructure provisioning.  
### **Step 15: AWS Client VPN / Cisco VPN Setup**  
- Set up **AWS Client VPN** or **Cisco VPN** to allow secure access to private AWS resources.  
- Example use case: **Accessing internal application URLs (e.g., https://user-registration-dev.techworldwithmurali.in).**  

**Prerequisites for AWS Client VPN Setup:**  
1. **AWS Directory Service** configuration  
2. **Amazon Certificate Manager (ACM)** for SSL/TLS certificates  

**Note:** Wherever applicable, we will use **Terraform** to automate infrastructure provisioning.  

### **Step 16: DevOps Tools Installation in Infra VPC**  
- Deploy essential DevOps tools in the **Infra VPC** for automation and CI/CD processes.  

**Tools to be installed:**  
- **Jenkins** - for CI/CD pipeline automation

- **JFrog Artifactory** - https://artifactory.techworldwithmurali.in  
- **SonarQube** - https://sonarqube.techworldwithmurali.in  

**Note:** These tools can either be deployed on **individual EC2 instances** or hosted in an **EKS (Kubernetes) cluster** for better scalability.  

### **Step 17: ECS or EKS setup for a microservice applications via Terraform.**  
- Deploy microservices in either:  
  - **ECS (Elastic Container Service)**  
  - **EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)**  
- The choice depends on **application architecture** and **team discussions**.
   
**Note:** Wherever applicable, we will use **Terraform** to automate infrastructure provisioning.  
### **Step 18: Monolithic Applications Setup via Terraform**  
- For **monolithic applications**, set up:  
  - **Auto Scaling Groups (ASG)**  
  - **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** (internal/external) for traffic distribution  
  - Create/update the records in **Route 53 hosted zone** etc.
    
**Note:** Wherever applicable, we will use **Terraform** to automate infrastructure provisioning.  
### **Step 19: Route 53 DNS Configuration**  
- Create a **Hosted Zone** in **Route 53**. Example:  
  - `techworldwithmurali.in`  
- Migrate DNS records to the **Route 53 hosted zone**, if applicable.  

### **Step 20: Database Setup**  
- Set up **Amazon RDS MySQL Cluster** as per the database requirements.  
- Inform the **DBA team** once provisioning is complete.  
**Note:** Wherever applicable, we will use **Terraform** to automate infrastructure provisioning.

**Responsibility:** The **DBA team** will handle this migration process.  

### **Step 21: Infrastructure Setup Completion Notification**  
- Once the infrastructure setup is complete:  
  - The **DevOps team** will notify the **Scrum Master**, **Development team**, and **QA team**.  
  - All corresponding **JIRA/Rally tickets** will be updated accordingly.  
  - A final **infrastructure validation checklist** will be completed to ensure:  
    - Networking components (VPC, subnets, security groups) are correctly configured.  
    - VPN connectivity is established and tested.  
    - DevOps tools are accessible and functional.  
    - Databases are provisioned, and accessible.  
    - Route 53 DNS records are correctly set up.  
  - Documentation, including **architecture diagrams, and access credentials**, will be shared in the designated **Confluence/JIRA **. 

## **Phase 3: Build, Deployment & Testing**  

### **Step 22: Development Team Preparation**  
- Developers implement any **necessary changes** to their applications for deployment.  

### **Step 23: Application Build**  
- Developers build the application using **Jenkins jobs**.  

### **Step 24: Deployment of Microservices/Monolithic Applications**  
- Developers deploy **microservices** in the **DEV environment** using **Jenkins jobs**. After deployment:  
  - **Load Balancers (LB), listeners, and Route 53 records** are automatically created using the **Ingress Controller** and **ExternalDNS**.  

- Developers deploy **monolithic applications** in the **DEV environment** using **Jenkins jobs**. After deployment:  
  - **Load Balancers, listeners, and Route 53 records** are automatically created via **Terraform**.  

### **Step 25: Testing the Application**  
- Validate the aplication whether the functionality is working as expected.

**Note:** Once testing is complete, we will shut down the application on the AWS side. During the cutover, we will bring the application back up.

## Phase 4: Final Cutover to AWS: Cutover Plan & Go-Live Checklist

### **Step 26: Schedule the Cutover Meeting**  
- Based on the final discussion, a **cutover date** will be finalized.  
- The **Scrum Master** will schedule the meeting.  
- The cutover process typically takes **3 to 4 hours**, but depending on the complexity of the applications, it may take longer.  

### **Step 27: Stop the Application in On-Premises**  
- Stop the on-premises application **after the final data sync**.  
- Ensure that no new transactions are being processed in the on-premises system.  

### **Step 28: DNS Cutover & Go-Live**  
- **Update DNS Records:** Modify **Route 53** records to point to the **AWS Load Balancer** endpoints.  
- **Enable AWS Application:** Make the AWS-hosted application live.  
- **Monitor Traffic Flow:** Ensure users are now connecting to AWS instead of the on-premises system.  

### **Step 29: Application Validation & QA Testing**  
- Developers and QA teams validate that the application functions as expected.  
- Ensure all **integrations, services, and APIs** are working correctly.  
- The QA team performs **regression testing** and notifies all relevant teams of any issues.  

### **Step 30: Monitoring & Stabilization**  
- Monitor the environment for a few **days** to detect any issues.  
- Address and resolve issues as needed with the **Development** or **DevOps** teams.
- 
### **Step 31: Rollback Plan (If Needed)**  
- If **issues occur**, attempt to **fix them on demand**.  
- If unresolved, **roll back the DNS endpoint** to the **on-premises** infrastructure.
  
### **Step 32: Migration to Other Environments**  
- If everything is **stable**, replicate the same process for:  
  - **TEST**  
  - **QA**  
  - **UAT**
