#### INSTRUCTOR DETAILS

### What is Cloud Computing?

- Cloud computing refers to the delivery of computing services—such as servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and more—over the internet ("the cloud").
- It enables users to access and utilize these resources on-demand, rather than maintaining physical hardware or infrastructure locally.

### Benefits of Cloud Computing

1. **Scalability:** Easily scale resources up or down based on demand.
2. **Cost Efficiency:** Pay only for what you use, reducing upfront costs.
3. **Flexibility:** Access resources from anywhere with an internet connection.
4. **Reliability:** Providers often offer high uptime and redundancy.
5. **Security:** Cloud providers invest in robust security measures.

### Types of Cloud Computing

## 1. Public Cloud
Resources are owned and operated by third-party providers, accessible over the internet by the general public.

**Example:**
1. **Amazon Web Services (AWS):** You can rent servers and storage space online.
2. **Microsoft Azure:** You can host websites and store data on Microsoft's servers.
3. **Google Cloud Platform (GCP):** You can use Google's infrastructure to run applications and store data.

## 2. Private Cloud
Dedicated resources operated solely for a single organization.

**Example:**
1. **Company Data Center:** A business has its own servers and storage in-house.
2. **VMware vSphere:** A company uses software to manage its own private servers.
3. **OpenStack:** A company sets up and manages its own cloud infrastructure using open-source tools.

## 3. Hybrid Cloud
Combination of public and private clouds, allowing data and applications to be shared between them.

### Types of Cloud Services
1. **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):**
- IaaS provides users with access to virtualized computing resources such as servers, storage, and networking, which can be used to build and deploy their own applications and services.
- Users are responsible for managing and maintaining the software and applications they deploy on the infrastructure provided by the IaaS provider.

**Examples:**

1. **Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2):**
   - Provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud.
   - Users can launch virtual servers, known as instances, and run applications on them.

2. **Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3):**
   - Scalable object storage service.
   - Users can store and retrieve any amount of data at any time.

3. **Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS):**
   - Provides block-level storage volumes for use with EC2 instances.
   - Users can create, attach, and manage storage volumes for their virtual servers.

4. **Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC):**
   - Enables users to launch AWS resources into a virtual network.
   - Users can control their virtual networking environment, including selection of IP address range, creation of subnets, and configuration of route tables and gateways.

2. **Platform as a Service (PaaS):** 

- PaaS provides users with a platform for building and deploying their own applications without having to worry about managing the underlying infrastructure.
- PaaS providers typically offer pre-configured software, tools, and application programming interfaces (APIs) that make it easier for developers to build, test, and deploy their applications.

**Examples:**

1. **AWS Elastic Beanstalk:**
   - A platform that allows users to deploy and manage applications without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.
   - Automatically handles the deployment, from capacity provisioning, load balancing, and auto-scaling to application health monitoring.

2. **AWS Lambda:**
   - A serverless compute service that lets users run code without provisioning or managing servers.
   - Users can run code in response to events and automatically scale from a few requests per day to thousands per second.

3. **Amazon API Gateway:**
   - A fully managed service that makes it easy for developers to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale.
   - Enables users to create RESTful APIs and WebSocket APIs for real-time two-way communication applications.

4. **Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS):**
   - A highly scalable, high-performance container orchestration service that supports Docker containers.
   - Allows users to easily run, stop, and manage containers on a cluster of EC2 instances.

3. **Software as a Service (SaaS):** 
- SaaS provides users with access to fully managed software applications and services that are hosted by a third-party provider.
- Users typically access SaaS applications through a web browser or mobile app, and the provider is responsible for maintaining and updating the software.

**Examples:**

1. **Amazon WorkSpaces:**
   - A managed, secure Desktop-as-a-Service (DaaS) solution.
   - Users can provision Windows or Linux desktops in just a few minutes and quickly scale to provide thousands of desktops to workers across the globe.

2. **Amazon Chime:**
   - A communications service that allows users to meet, chat, and place business calls inside and outside of their organization.
   - Provides a secure, scalable, and feature-rich communications platform accessible from any device.

3. **Amazon WorkDocs:**
   - A secure enterprise document storage and sharing service.
   - Allows users to create, edit, and share content, and provides administrative controls and feedback capabilities.

4. **Amazon WorkMail:**
   - A secure, managed business email and calendaring service.
   - Compatible with existing email clients and offers strong security features to protect data.

### What is AWS?

AWS (Amazon Web Services) is a comprehensive, evolving cloud computing platform provided by Amazon.com. It offers a wide range of services including computing power, storage, databases, machine learning, analytics, and more.

### Advantages of AWS

1. **Global Reach:** Extensive global infrastructure with regions and availability zones.
2. **Scalability:** Easily scale resources up or down.
3. **Cost-Effective:** Pay-as-you-go pricing model reduces upfront costs.
4. **Security:** Strong security measures and compliance certifications.
5. **Innovation:** Continuous updates and introduction of new services.

### Disadvantages of AWS

1. **Complexity:** Vast array of services can lead to complexity in management.
2. **Cost Management:** Potential for costs to escalate without proper monitoring.

----
### AWS Global Infrastructure

#### Regions

AWS Regions are geographical locations where AWS data centers are clustered. Each region consists of multiple Availability Zones.

#### Availability Zones

Availability Zones (AZs) are isolated locations within regions, each containing one or more data centers. They are designed to be independent yet interconnected to provide high availability and fault tolerance.
