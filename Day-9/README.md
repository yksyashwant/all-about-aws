#### INSTRUCTOR DETAILS

### What is an AWS Network Load Balancer?

AWS Network Load Balancer (NLB) is a load balancing solution designed to handle high volumes of traffic with low latency. It operates at the transport layer (Layer 4) and is capable of handling millions of requests per second while maintaining ultra-low latencies.

### Benefits of an AWS Network Load Balancer

1. **High Throughput:** Handles millions of requests per second with ultra-low latencies.
2. **Static IP:** Provides a static IP address per Availability Zone (AZ) for easy integration with applications.
3. **TLS Termination:** Supports TLS termination for end-to-end encryption.
4. **Target Group Support:** Routes traffic to target groups using IP addresses and ports.
5. **Health Checks:** Performs health checks on targets to ensure only healthy targets receive traffic.

### Difference between an Application Load Balancer (ALB) and a Network Load Balancer (NLB)

| Feature                         | Application Load Balancer (ALB)                          | Network Load Balancer (NLB)                              |
|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Layer**                       | Operates at Layer 7 (Application layer)                  | Operates at Layer 4 (Transport layer)                    |
| **Use Case**                    | Ideal for HTTP/HTTPS traffic and advanced routing        | Ideal for TCP, UDP, and TLS traffic requiring high performance |
| **Routing**                     | Supports advanced routing based on HTTP headers, paths, and hostnames | Routes traffic based on IP protocol data without inspection |
| **Performance**                 | Suitable for applications requiring intelligent routing decisions | High performance, low latency required for real-time applications |
| **Protocol Support**            | HTTP, HTTPS, WebSocket                                   | TCP, UDP, TLS                                            |
| **SSL Termination**             | Supports SSL termination                                 | Supports SSL passthrough and SSL termination             |
| **Target Type**                 | Can route to EC2 instances, IP addresses, Lambda functions | Can route to EC2 instances, IP addresses, and AWS PrivateLink endpoints |
| **Health Checks**               | Supports health checks based on HTTP/HTTPS status codes and content | Supports health checks based on TCP connections and responses |
| **WebSocket Support**           | Yes                                                      | No                                                       |
| **Sticky Sessions**             | Yes, using cookies                                       | No                                                       |
| **Host-based and Path-based Routing** | Yes                                                      | No                                                       |
| **Cost**                        | Generally more expensive due to advanced features        | Generally less expensive due to its simplicity and lower overhead |
