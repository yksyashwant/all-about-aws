### What is AWS WAF?

- AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall) is a security service from AWS that protects your website or web app from common online threats like hackers, bots, and malicious traffic, which could slow down your app, expose sensitive data, or use up too many resources.
- It allows you to control which traffic to allow or block to your web applications by defining customizable web security rules.
  
## What it Protects

- **Amazon CloudFront distributions**
- **Amazon API Gateway REST APIs**
- **Application Load Balancers**
- **AWS AppSync GraphQL APIs**
- **Amazon Cognito user pools**
- **AWS App Runner services**
- **AWS Verified Access instances**

  
### Key Features of AWS WAF:

1. **Managed Rulesets**:
   - AWS WAF provides managed rulesets that include pre-configured rules to protect against common threats such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and known bad bots.
   - These rulesets are regularly updated to include new protections.

2. **Customizable Rules**:
   - You can create custom rules to define specific conditions under which the AWS WAF should allow, block, or monitor web requests.
   - These rules can be based on IP addresses, HTTP headers, URI strings, or combinations thereof.

3. **Integration with AWS Services**:
   - AWS WAF integrates seamlessly with other AWS services like Amazon CloudFront (CDN), Application Load Balancer (ALB), API Gateway, and AWS AppSync, allowing you to protect applications deployed on these services.

4. **Monitoring and Logging**:
   - AWS WAF provides metrics and logs through AWS CloudWatch, giving you visibility into web traffic patterns and potential security threats.
   - You can set up alarms based on these metrics to alert you to potential attacks.

5. **Scalability and Performance**:
   - AWS WAF automatically scales with your application traffic and provides low-latency performance by leveraging AWS's global network of edge locations.

6. **Rate Limiting and Bot Control**:
   - You can configure rate-based rules to protect against application-layer attacks such as brute force login attempts or HTTP floods. AWS WAF also includes bot control features to identify and mitigate automated threats.

   - Click on "Create Web ACL."
   - Enter a name and description for your Web ACL.
   - Define rules using conditions (e.g., IP addresses, HTTP headers, URI strings).
   - Add rules to the Web ACL and configure actions (allow, block, count, etc.) based on rule matches.
   - Click "Create" to create the Web ACL.
----
#### Applying a Web ACL to an Application Load Balancer (ALB)

1. **Sign in to AWS Management Console:**
   - Navigate to the AWS WAF & Shield Dashboard at [AWS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/wafv2/).

2. **Select Web ACL:**
   - Choose the Web ACL you created or want to apply.

3. **Associate with ALB:**
   - Click on "Associations" in the left-hand navigation pane.
   - Click "Add association" to associate the Web ACL with your Application Load Balancer (ALB).
   - Select the ALB and configure the association settings.
   - Save the association to apply the Web ACL to the ALB.
