#### INSTRUCTOR DETAILS

### What is AWS Elastic Load Balancing?

AWS Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets, such as EC2 instances, containers, IP addresses, and Lambda functions, to ensure high availability and fault tolerance for your applications.

### Benefits of AWS Elastic Load Balancing

1. **High Availability:** Distributes traffic across multiple instances or targets, reducing the risk of overloading any single resource.
2. **Fault Tolerance:** Automatically routes traffic away from unhealthy targets to healthy ones.
3. **Scalability:** Handles varying traffic loads by scaling resources up or down automatically.
4. **Security:** Provides SSL/TLS termination to encrypt traffic and integration with AWS WAF for web application firewall protection.

### What is an AWS Classic Load Balancer?

AWS Classic Load Balancer (CLB) is the original load balancer offering from AWS, primarily designed for applications that were built within the EC2-Classic network. It supports both EC2-Classic and EC2-VPC platforms.

### Features of a Classic Load Balancer

1. **Layer 4 and Layer 7 Load Balancing:** Supports both TCP (Layer 4) and HTTP/HTTPS (Layer 7) traffic.
2. **Sticky Sessions:** Supports session affinity, directing requests to the same instance.
3. **Health Checks:** Monitors the health of registered instances and routes traffic only to healthy instances.
4. **Cross-Zone Load Balancing:** Distributes traffic evenly across instances in multiple Availability Zones.

### What is an AWS Target Group?

An AWS Target Group is used with Application Load Balancers and Network Load Balancers to route requests to one or more registered targets, such as EC2 instances, IP addresses, or Lambda functions, based on routing rules.

### What is a Listener?

A Listener is a process that checks for connection requests from clients and manages traffic for one or more ports, forwarding requests to target groups associated with AWS load balancers based on rules defined for each listener.

### Lab Session - Creation of an AWS Target Group

1. **Sign in to AWS Management Console:**
   - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard at [AWS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/).

2. **Create Target Group:**
   - Click on "Target Groups" in the left sidebar under "Load Balancing."
   - Click on "Create target group" and follow the wizard:
     - Define target group name, protocol (HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, etc.), and port.
     - Configure health checks to monitor the health of targets.
     - Register targets (EC2 instances, IP addresses, or Lambda functions) with the target group.
     - Complete the creation of the target group.
----
### What is an AWS Application Load Balancer?

AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB) operates at the application layer (Layer 7) and directs traffic based on URL routing rules, allowing multiple applications to be hosted on a single load balancer. It supports advanced routing, SSL termination, and content-based routing.

### Benefits of an AWS Application Load Balancer

1. **Content-Based Routing:** Routes traffic based on content of the request (e.g., URL path).
2. **Host-Based Routing:** Routes traffic based on host headers.
3. **Path-Based Routing:** Routes traffic based on URL paths.
4. **WebSocket Support:** Supports WebSocket traffic.
5. **Integrated with AWS WAF:** Provides protection against common web exploits and SQL injection.
